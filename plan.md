# General

## Adapted Goals
- Overworld with one section
- Characters without state (no memory of past conversations)
- Simple inventory management (Only one slot per category)
- Stats: No adaptive learning from combat, no damage-specific attacks for different enemies
- Simple saving in menu (No savepoints)
- No or only basic audio
- Only simple Main Menu

## Libraries
(So far)
- SFML: Graphics, input
- ImGui: UI
- Tiled / tileson: Create map
- spdlog: Logging
- Assets: Ninja adventure asset pack
